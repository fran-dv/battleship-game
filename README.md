## About the project
The web version of the classic Battleship game, featuring a clean, modern UI. This project is an assignment in the JavaScript section of The Odin Project curriculum. Its primary goal was to practice TDD (Test-Driven Development). I made it with my own approach, using a modern technology stack, and I wrote all tests using [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/). See the original project assignment [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-battleship)

## UI & Gameplay

- Both player boards render in the browser; clicking a cell on the enemy board triggers an attack.
- After each move, the targeted cell updates to show a hit or miss.
- The game ends when all ships on one side are sunk, with an option to play again.

## Features

- Fully responsive and intuitive user interface 
- Immersive experience with ambient music and sound effects
